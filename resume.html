        <h2>The Issue at hand:</h2>
        <p>New York City for years now has been in a housing crisis with nothing to show on trying to fix the situation. This is why I am making a proposal on how to fix this situation or at least show some awareness for the things gone wrong. The housing crisis in question is the amount of apartments that are extremely overpriced and how much people that can't afford these living conditions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="resume-section">
        <h2>Some of the causes</h2>
        <p>A higher demand for more housing has appeared aftert this rise in pricing, the limited space in NYC causes less and less apartments to be built, regulations such as rent control raise the prices A LOT, and lastly real estate speculation can cause rent prices to sky rocket since property values go up.</p>

        <h2>So what are some solutions to this madness?</h2>
  
        <div class="project-wrapper">
          <section class="project-item">
            <h3>Creating New Programs</h3>
            <p>Creating new programs to make vacant sites for new apartment complexes. Which is simply saying that the local gonvernment could make prograns to generate vacant plots of land to create these large complexes which is great for the economy of the area and the social interaction for the community.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-item">
            <h3>Lower Income Housing</h3>
            <p>Increasing the amount of lower quality apartments to make low income housing. This is a very fiancial decision to make for the government. It's within the means of making all new buildings and setting prices up for the lower income community, causing less havoc.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="project-item">
            <h3>Get Rid of Unused Land</h3>
            <p>Manufacture affordable housing in unused public/private sites. A lot of places in NYC are simply just unused public/private plots of land so the gonvernment can just take those plots to land to create new buildings such as new rentals.</p>
